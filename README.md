# Contract Parser

A Vite React application for parsing and displaying JSON contracts. Had a blast with this takehome :)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## Testing

Upload one of the sample JSON files from the `test-files` directory to see the parser in action.

The project includes two sample JSON contract files in the `test-files` directory:

- `contract.json`: A basic service agreement contract
- `test-contract.json`: An extended service agreement with more complex structure

These files can be used to test the application's functionality without having to create your own contract JSON.
